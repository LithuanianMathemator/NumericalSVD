# NumericalSVD

My bachelor's thesis is concerned with the numerical computation of the singular value decomposition. This repository has all the implementations that get discussed in the thesis, alongside the scripts used to generate the figures and examples in it.

## Algorithms:
- Bidiagonalization
- Golub-Kahan-Reinsch
- Divide and Conquer SVD
- One-sided Jacobi
